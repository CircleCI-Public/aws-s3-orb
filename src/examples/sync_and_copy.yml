  The S3 orb allows you to "sync" directories or "copy" files to an S3 bucket.
  The example below shows a typical CircleCI job where a file "bucket/build_asset.txt" is created,
  followed by how we can both sync, and/or copy the file. It also demonstrates the use of OIDC authentication
  by providing a valid AWS role-arn.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    aws-s3: circleci/aws-s3@3.1
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/python:3.10
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run: mkdir bucket && echo "lorem ipsum" > bucket/build_asset.txt
        - aws-s3/sync:
            from: bucket
            to: "s3://my-s3-bucket-name/prefix"
            arguments: |
              --acl public-read \
              --cache-control "max-age=86400"
            role-arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012/role/VALID-S3-ROLE
        - aws-s3/copy:
            from: bucket/build_asset.txt
            to: "s3://my-s3-bucket-name"
            arguments: --dryrun
            # Skip aws cli installation step since it's already installed above
