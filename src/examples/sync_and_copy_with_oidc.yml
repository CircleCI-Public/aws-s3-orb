  The S3 orb allows you to "sync" directories or "copy" files to an S3 bucket.
  The example below shows a typical CircleCI job where a file "bucket/build_asset.txt" is created,
  followed by how we can both sync, and/or copy the file. It also demonstrates the use of OIDC authentication by importing
  the aws-cli orb and providing the aws-cli/setup command with a valid AWS role_arn and profile name.
  If a profile name is specified with authentication, it must be specified in the copy and sync commands.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    aws-s3: circleci/aws-s3@4.1
    # Importing aws-cli orb is required
    aws-cli: circleci/aws-cli@5.1.1
  jobs:
    sync_and_copy:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:current
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run: mkdir bucket && echo "lorem ipsum" > bucket/build_asset.txt
        # Add authentication step with OIDC using aws-cli/setup command
        - aws-cli/setup:
            role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012/role/VALID-S3-ROLE
            profile_name: "OIDC-User"
        - aws-s3/sync:
            # Profile name must be the same as authentication step
            profile_name: "OIDC-User"
            from: bucket
            to: "s3://my-s3-bucket-name/prefix"
            arguments: |
              --acl public-read \
              --cache-control "max-age=86400"
        - aws-s3/copy:
            # Profile name must be the same as authentication step
            profile_name: "OIDC-User"
            from: bucket/build_asset.txt
            to: "s3://my-s3-bucket-name"
